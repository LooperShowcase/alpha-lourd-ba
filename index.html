      <h1>Swimming</h1>

      <p>
        Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of
        one's entire body to move through water. The sport takes place in pools
        or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of
        the most popular Olympic sports,[1] with varied distance events in
        butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley.
        In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take part in
        either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley relay consists of four
        swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke,
        breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.[2] Swimming each stroke requires
        a set of specific techniques; in competition, there are distinct
        regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual
        stroke.[3] There are also regulations on what types of swimsuits, caps,
        jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions.[4] Although it
        is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the
        sport, such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, there are also
        multiple health benefits associated with the sport.
